# New York City Covid-19 Interactive Charts
The project aims to create a webapp to visualize the Covid-19 data in New York City by zipcode. 
### In Development 
```
conda install altair -c conda-forge 
conda install folium -c conda-forge
git clone "https://github.com/yam020/NYCCIC.git"
cd ./NYCCIC
pip install -e . 
```
### Note:
```
cd ./NYCCIC
uvicorn NYCCIC.app:app
```
Or you can run the app.py directly. 

Go to '/map'. You can see a map. (very rough version)
Everything is under construction.
