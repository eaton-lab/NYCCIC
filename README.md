# Project
Class Project for EEEB 4050 
<br> An outline of a new project idea (for now)

### Description of project goal:
Users can input a CSV data. 
The program can format input data appropriately, 
build the model by using Bayesian inference 
and return the custom plots and tables of results in the API interface

### Description of the code:
Pymc3: Bayesian inference
Pandas: Data formatting 
Numpy: Data formatting 
Matplotlib: Plots 
fastAPI: For the API interface 

### Description of the data:
Input is a CSV file from user. 

### Description of user interaction:
User could call the program from the command line interface.
