# Proposal 
## New York City COVID-19 Interactive Charts

### The goal of the project 
The project aims to create a webapp to visualize the COVID-19 data in New York 
<br> City by zipcode. 
### The reasoning of the project
<br> The inspiration comes from my own experience in renting apartment during 
<br> the pandemic. One thing I considered when renting is the pandemic status of <br> the neighborhoods. There are two websites help me a lot during the process. <br> One is from [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html). And the other is from [New York Gov].(https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#7day) 
<br> However, for the New York Gov website, users can't access the Covid-19 data <br> by zipcode (except hospitalizaion and death). For the New York Times, it contains detailed information and beautiful graphs.  

### Description of the project
<br> By entering the desired zipcode/boroughs, users are able to see the trend 
<br> grpahs of COVID-19 case/death/test/hospitalized/vaccinated number in that 
<br> particular area.
<br> The webapp also provides a map of new york that display the new case/total 
<br> case/tests/vaccine/death in New York City. The map is divided by zipcode. 
<br> Users can move their mouse over the interested area to check the Covid-19 
<br> situation.
