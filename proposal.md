# Proposal 
## New York City COVID-19 Interactive Charts

### The goal of the project 
The project aims to create a webapp to visualize the COVID-19 data in New York City by zipcode. 

### The reasoning of the project
The inspiration comes from my own experience in renting apartment during the pandemic. 
<br> One thing I considered when renting is the pandemic status of the neighborhoods. There are two websites help me a lot during the process. 
<br> One is from [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html). And the other is from [New York Gov](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#7day) 
<br> However, for the New York Gov website, users can't access the Covid-19 data by zipcode (except hospitalizaion and death). It is not very friendly to people <br> who are totally new to the city. (like myself) 
<br> For the New York Times, it contains detailed information and beautiful graphs, but requires subscription. (It is super amazing. I just don't read news that <br> much.)
<br> Currently, there are so many Covid-19 data available online. My main goal is to use this data and create a webapp that can visualize these data in New York <br> City by zipcode. By creating this webapp, I hope I can collect many aspects of COVID-19 data and group them by zipcodes. Meanwhile, I hope I can present a <br> clear and beautiful visulaziation of COVID-19 data, so people can gain a clear understanding of the pandemic status.
<br> As a conclusion, I hope this webapp can help people raise their awareness of COVID-19 in their own community. Though the pandemic cases are falling, 
<br> we should still stay vigilant. 

### Description of the project
The COVID-19 data: case (new/total), death, test, hospitalized, vaccinated.
<br> By entering the desired zipcode/boroughs, users are able to see the trend graphs of COVID-19 case/death/test/hospitalized/vaccinated number in that 
<br> particular area.
<br> The webapp also provides a map of new york that display the new case/total case/tests/vaccine/death in New York City. 
<br> The map is divided by zipcode. Users can move their mouse over to the interested area to check the Covid-19 situation.

### Type of data/input will a user provide to the program
Users are able to enter the zipcode, or click the boroughs options. 
<br> Users can also their mouse over to their interested ares to check the data.
<br> All graphs can be zoom in/out.
