# Proposal 
## New York City COVID-19 Interactive Charts

### The goal of the project 
The project aims to create a webapp to visualize the Covid-19 data in New York City by zipcode. 

### The reasoning of the project
The inspiration comes from my own experience in renting apartment during the pandemic. One thing I considered when renting is the pandemic status of the         neighborhoods. There are two websites help me a lot during the process. One is from [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html). And the other is from [New York Gov](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#7day). However, for the New York Gov website, users can't access the Covid-19 data by zipcode (except hospitalizaion and death). It is not very friendly to people who are totally new to the city. (like myself)  For the New York Times, it contains detailed information and beautiful graphs, but requires subscription. (The New York Times is amazing. I just don't read news that much.) Currently, there are so many Covid-19 data available online. My main goal is to use this data and create a webapp that can visualize these data in New York City by zipcode. By creating this webapp, I hope I can collect many aspects of Covid-19 data and group them by zipcodes. Meanwhile, I hope I can present a clear and beautiful visulaziation of Covid-19 data, so people can gain a clear understanding of the pandemic status. As a conclusion, I hope this webapp can help people raise their awareness of Covid-19 in their own community. Though the pandemic cases are falling, we should still stay vigilant. 

### Description of the project
The Covid-19 data: case (new/total), death, test, hospitalized, vaccinated.
<br> By entering the desired zipcode/boroughs, users are able to see the trend graphs of Covid-19 case/death/test/hospitalized/vaccinated number in that particular area. The webapp also provides a map of new york that display the new case/total case/tests/vaccine/death in New York City.The map is divided by zipcode. Users can move their mouse over to the interested area to check the Covid-19 situation.

### Description of User interaction 
Users can access the webapp by visiting website: -------. The webapp displays one trend graph and one map. For the trend graphs, users are able to enter the zipcode, or boroughs. Also, users can choose what type of Covid-19 data they want to observe. For the map, users can move their mouse over to their interested ares to check the data. All graphs can be zoom in/out. 
#### Type of data/input a user provide to the program
